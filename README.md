# Pulsar
Pulsar is an app written in the Rust programming language for the COSMIC desktop environment. It is designed to play music, can list files by tags such as artist and album, and can manage a queue.

## Getting Started
To use pulsar, check the right side of GitHub for the latest release under "Releases". Click on it, and select the executable applicable to your operating system. Alternatively, you can clone the repository and use just install to install it to your computer.
